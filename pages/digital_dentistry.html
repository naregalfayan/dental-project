    <!--GENERAL INFORMATION-->

      <h1 class="section_header">DIGITAL DENTISTRY SERVICES</h1>
      <p>
        We’re an entirely digital and “green” dental laboratory. Our
        computerized charting system
        <br />
        helps us dramatically reduce the amount of paper that we use in our
        office while allowing
        <br />
        us to keep incredibly accurate and secure dental records. These digital
        charts help us
        <br />
        communicate quickly with other doctors, which means you get
        comprehensive, personalized
        <br />
        care that was unheard of only 10 years ago. We are thrilled to announce
        that we are the
        <br />
        first cosmetic dental practice to incorporate the groundbreaking Dexis
        CariVu system—a
        <br />
        completely RADIATION-FREE way to see inside your teeth! This
        state-of-the-art technology
        <br />
        combines a high-resolution digital camera with near-infrared light to
        keep you healthier
        <br />
        with less radiation. Dexis CariVu is a compact device that uses patented
        transillumination
        <br />
        technology to support the identification of cavities and cracks.

      <p>
        Even our x-rays are improved! The x-rays that we take with our Dexis
        Digital X-Ray Sensor are
        <br />
        a world of difference from the imperfect film x-rays of the past. We’re
        now able to drastically
        <br />
        minimize the amount of radiation that you’re exposed to. These days, you
        get more radiation by
        <br />
        walking outside every single day than you do getting an x-ray at our
        office. Since there isn’t
        <br />
        any more film to develop we don’t have to use those awful development
        chemicals either, which helps
        <br />
        our office remain even more environmentally-friendly.

            Another digital dentistry service is our digital camera
            <br />
            documentation method. The intra-oral camera a small camera that we
            use to take pictures of
            <br />
            different things inside your mouth. So now when we tell you that you
            have a cavity or a crack in
            <br />
            your tooth, you’ll be able to see it too! The camera helps many
            patients to feel at ease and trust
            <br />
            our doctors’ recommendations because you will see exactly what they
            see. You will no longer have
            <br />
            to worry about having work done that is unnecessary. Our Canon Rebel
            DSLR camera will help document
            <br />
            your treatment from start to finish for the full “WOW” effect! When
            you need implants, bridges, or
            <br />
            dentures our Beverly Hills cosmetic dental digital practice helps us
            create accurate, natural
            <br />
            prosthetics that fit just right. That means that you’ll be more
            comfortable and more successful with
            <br />
            your crowns, bridges, dentures, or implants. We’re not going to stop
            there, either. We’re committed to
            <br />
            equipping our office with cutting edge technology. We’ll continue to
            evolve as the dental profession
            <br />
            continues to evolve, so that we can give you the absolute best
            care—now and in the future.
