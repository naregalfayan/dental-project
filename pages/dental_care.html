      <p>
        As general dental care providers, we serve patients of all ages.
        <br />
        That means we can treat everyone in your family while handling a wide
        range of issues.
        <br />
        We have the experience and education to tailor your dentistry experience
        to your personal
        <br />
        needs, regardless of your specific oral health concerns. Below, we’ve
        assembled a list of
        <br />
        some of the questions we hear on a regular basis
      </p>
      <div class="dental-care-list-container">
        <ul class="dental-care_list">
          <li>
            Will this tooth have to come out?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                We only really need to extract teeth when they have problems we
                <br />
                can’t fix. This means that the entire tooth has been
                compromised, or
                <br />
                that a fracture has damaged the root of the tooth.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Will I need a root canal procedure? What is it, exactly?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                Sometimes a cavity can become so big that it infects the nerve
                <br />
                inside of the tooth. This causes pain and swelling, and you’ll
                <br />
                need a root canal to fix it. First, we give you a numbing agent
                so
                <br />
                that you don’t feel any pain. Then, we remove the decayed
                portion
                <br />
                of the tooth and clean out the infected nerve. We then use a
                <br />
                material called “gutta percha” to fill the space where the nerve
                <br />
                used to be in order to keep bacteria from attacking the tooth
                <br />
                again. You’ll usually need a crown after a root canal, as the
                <br />
                tooth usually loses a lot of strength.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            What is a bridge? What’s the difference between bridges and
            dentures?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                We use bridges to replace missing teeth. Healthy teeth must be
                <br />
                present on both sides of the open space. We place crowns on each
                <br />
                of these teeth, which holds a third crown in place, closing the
                gap.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                If you have a lot of lost teeth you will generally need dentures
                <br />
                instead. Full dentures replace all of the teeth, and partial
                <br />
                dentures replace only a few teeth. We can combine dentures with
                <br />
                dental implants so you get better stability when talking and
                eating.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            What are crowns?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                We use crowns (or “caps”) to restore your tooth’s form and
                <br />
                function when a filling is insufficient to restore the damage
                from
                <br />
                either decay or a fracture. We shape the affected tooth to hold
                <br />
                the crown, which will completely cover the exterior of the
                tooth.
                <br />
                Your tooth will look and feel as good as new by the time we’re
                done.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            How do fillings work?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                First, we remove any decayed matter inside of your tooth, until
                <br />
                only the healthy tooth is left. Next, we add a series of bonding
                <br />
                agents to your tooth so that the filling will actually stick. We
                <br />
                then place white, tooth-colored fillings known as composite
                <br />
                fillings inside of your tooth. This restores the shape of your
                <br />
                tooth and stops the decay in its tracks. We cure the composite
                <br />
                with ultra-violet light to harden it. Finally, we shape it and
                <br />
                polish it, which restores the tooth’s natural look and feel.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            What is a deep cleaning?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                A deep cleaning is required when a patient’s gums are unhealthy.
                <br />
                This usually results in bone loss around the teeth, which causes
                <br />
                “pockets.” A deeper pocket really endangers the tooth, so it’s
                <br />
                important to handle the situation right away. We use the scaling
                <br />
                and root planning technique to remove bacteria and tartar that
                has
                <br />
                settled underneath the gums.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            How do I know you won’t do a bunch of unnecessary work?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                We never perform unnecessary work. We are medical professionals,
                <br />
                just like your doctor is. We give you an honest assessment of
                <br />
                what’s going on in your mouth. We’ll do our best to keep you
                <br />
                informed with CariVu images, intra-oral pictures, x-rays, and
                <br />
                explanations on why we are recommending treatment.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Ultimately, you are in control of whether you receive treatment
                or
                <br />
                not. It is simply our ethical duty to report our findings and to
                <br />
                present options for treatment. We welcome any questions that you
                <br />
                may have. We want you to feel confident that you have all of the
                <br />
                information you need to make an informed decision.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Is this going to hurt?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                Our number one question! But in general, dental work does not
                <br />
                hurt. In fact, we make sure to numb the area we’re working on so
                <br />
                that you don’t feel any pain during your procedure. We also use
                a
                <br />
                special desensitizing agent underneath all of our fillings,
                <br />
                crowns, and veneers, which reduces post-operative pain. Some
                <br />
                patients do experience very minor temperature sensitivities and
                <br />
                biting sensitivities for a few days after some procedures. This
                is
                <br />
                completely normal. You can easily relieve this pain by using an
                <br />
                over-the-counter pain reliever and rinsing with warm salt water.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            What are some common reasons why people need dental treatment?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                There are lots of different reasons why a tooth might need
                dental
                <br />
                work. Cavities are the most common problem. Cavities happen when
                <br />
                bacteria eats away a portion of the tooth. The tooth then
                becomes
                <br />
                soft, and infected. The area must be cleaned and filled right
                away
                <br />
                to prevent further damage.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                We also see a lot of fractures or cracks. These can happen when
                <br />
                the tooth suffers from some sort of trauma (such as being
                smacked
                <br />
                by a baseball), but it can also happen when a patient chews on
                <br />
                ice, or something hard.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Finally, we also see cases of extreme wear, especially in
                patients
                <br />
                who grind their teeth, or who suffer from acid reflux disease
                and
                <br />
                thus from tooth erosion.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            My teeth don’t hurt, so I’m fine, right?
            <ul>
              <br />
              <li>
                Most patients only go to the dentist when they feel pain.
                However,
                <br />
                a lack of pain does not mean a lack of dental issues! Some
                dental
                <br />
                issues can cause damage for quite some time before they actually
                hurt.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                We recommend you receive a professional cleaning and check-up
                <br />
                every 3-4 months. This is the easiest, best, and least expensive
                <br />
                way to ensure that your mouth remains healthy and strong.
